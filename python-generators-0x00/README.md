# Python Generators: Efficient Data Processing and Streaming

This project explores advanced techniques in Python generators for efficient handling of large datasets, batched processing, and simulating live data streams.  It leverages the `yield` keyword to create generators that provide iterative access to data, optimizing memory usage and enhancing performance in data-intensive applications.

## Project Overview

The core focus of this project is mastering Python generators and their application in various scenarios.  The tasks within this project demonstrate how generators can be used to:

* **Stream data efficiently:** Process large datasets without loading them entirely into memory.
* **Implement batch processing:** Handle data in manageable chunks for improved performance and resource utilization.
* **Simulate real-world scenarios:** Model systems with continuous data updates, like sensor readings or stock tickers.
* **Improve code clarity and conciseness:** Generators often lead to more elegant and readable code compared to traditional iterators.

## Key Concepts

* **Generators:** Functions using `yield` that return an iterator.  They produce values on demand, pausing execution until the next value is requested.
* **Iterators:** Objects that implement the iterator protocol, allowing traversal of a sequence of values.
* **`yield` keyword:** Pauses generator execution and returns a value.  Resumes execution from where it left off when the next value is requested.
* **Memory efficiency:** Generators process data piece by piece, reducing memory footprint, especially crucial for large datasets.
* **Lazy evaluation:** Computations are performed only when needed, optimizing performance.

## Requirements

* Proficiency in Python 3.x.
* Understanding of yield and Pythonâ€™s generator functions.
* Familiarity with SQL and database operations (MySQL and SQLite).
* Basic knowledge of database schema design and data seeding.

* Ability to use Git and GitHub for version control and submission.
